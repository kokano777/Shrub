# Shrub

BIOL694 Final project

## Researcg

The Arctic has been warming nearly four times as fast as the rest of the world. My study focuses on how this rapid warming affects environments and ecology and how the changes affect carbon balance.

## Input files

-Data (.csv files) contain carbon flux data (e.g. Net primary productivity) and environmental data (e.g. albedo, temperature) in 2022 from Eddy covariance flux tower at Shrub tundra that has a snow fence, near Toolik Field Station, Alaska, USA.

-Original spreadsheet available by email: contact kokano@alaska.edu. 
 
## Code

**1. Purpose**

    -The purpose is to compare the effects of snow accumulation on carbon fluxes between snow drift site and control using PCA.

**2. Usage**

    -The code is for separating a file into two: south (contorl) and north (snow drift), run pca, plot the ordination, and save the plot by pdf.

**3. Content**

    -R script.
